Production Installation
===============

## Virtual Environment

It is recommended you install a [virtual environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_environment_software). There are many options like [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) and [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). This installation instruction will use  [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

The instructions to install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) can be found at [https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) can be used both for installing packages and for creating a [virtual environment](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-conda-virtual-environments-eaea4ac84e28).

To create the environment after [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) is installed, run -

```
conda create -n spyglass-env python=3.9.0
```

The name selected here is ```spyglass-env```. However, a different name can be used if desired or necessary.

Now, it is time to activate the virtual environment. To start, run -

```
conda activate spyglass-env
```

## Installing Spyglass

`spyglass` can be installed via [pip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)) off of [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/spyglass-neuro/):

```bash
pip install spyglass-neuro
```

## Additional Packages

Some pipelines require installation of additional packages. For example, the spike sorting pipeline relies on `spikeinterface`. We recommend installing it directly from the GitHub repo:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface.git
```

You may also need to install individual sorting algorithms. For example, Loren Frank's lab at [UCSF](https://www.ucsf.edu/) typically uses `mountainsort4`:

```bash
pip install mountainsort4
```

WARNING: If you are on an M1 Mac, you need to install `pyfftw` via `conda` BEFORE installing `ghostipy`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pyfftw
```

The LFP pipeline uses `ghostipy`:

```bash
pip install ghostipy
```

## Setting up database access

1. To use `spyglass`, you need to have access to a MySQL database. If your lab already administers a database, connect to it by setting [DataJoint](https://www.datajoint.org/) configurations. If you want to run your own database, consult instructions in [datajoint tutorial](https://tutorials.datajoint.org/setting-up/get-database.html) and/or [our tutorial notebook](./notebooks/docker_mysql_tutorial.ipynb).

2. Add the following environment variables (e.g. in `~/.bashrc`). The following are specific to Frank lab so you may want to change `SPYGLASS_BASE_DIR`.

   ```bash
   export SPYGLASS_BASE_DIR="/stelmo/nwb"
   export SPYGLASS_RECORDING_DIR="$SPYGLASS_BASE_DIR/recording"
   export SPYGLASS_SORTING_DIR="$SPYGLASS_BASE_DIR/sorting"
   export SPYGLASS_VIDEO_DIR="$SPYGLASS_BASE_DIR/video"
   export SPYGLASS_WAVEFORMS_DIR="$SPYGLASS_BASE_DIR/waveforms"
   export SPYGLASS_TEMP_DIR="$SPYGLASS_BASE_DIR/tmp/spyglass"
   export DJ_SUPPORT_FILEPATH_MANAGEMENT="TRUE"
   ```

   Note that a local `SPYGLASS_TEMP_DIR` (e.g. one on your machine) will speed up spike sorting, but make sure it has enough free space (ideally at least 500GB)

   Before proceeding, run -

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   in order to persist the changes.

3. Set up [`kachery-cloud`](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/kachery-cloud) (if you are in Frank lab, skip this step). Once you have initialized a `kachery-cloud` directory, add the following environment variables (again, shown for Frank lab).

   ```bash
   export KACHERY_CLOUD_DIR="$SPYGLASS_BASE_DIR/.kachery-cloud"
   export KACHERY_TEMP_DIR="$SPYGLASS_BASE_DIR/tmp"
   ```

    Before proceeding, run -

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   in order to persist the changes.

4. Configure DataJoint. To connect to the [DataJoint](https://www.datajoint.org/) database, we have to specify information about it such as the hostname and the port. You should also change your password from the temporary one you were given. Download [`dj_config.py`](https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass/blob/master/config/dj_config.py) from [https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass/blob/master/config/dj_config.py](https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass/blob/master/config/dj_config.py) and save locally as `dj_config.py`, to any folder. Instructions on how to download a single file from github can be found at [https://stackoverflow.com/a/13593430/178550](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13593430/178550). Then run `dj_config.py` in a terminal with your username -

    ```bash
    python dj_config.py <username> # run the configuration script
    ```

Finally, open up a python console (e.g. run `ipython` from terminal) and import `spyglass` to check that the installation has worked.
