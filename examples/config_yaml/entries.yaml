# This file should live in the SPYGLASS BASE directory.

# This YAML is used to populate spyglass tables when the spyglass.common module is loaded.
# This is an easy way to pre-populate the tables, especially with controlled vocabularies (preferred terms
# for a set of concepts).
# Using controlled vocabularies helps ensure that a preferred term or definition is used,
# e.g. "SpikeGadgets" and not "spikegadgets". Using inconsistent terms for the same concept creates confusion and
# makes search queries on the concept difficult.
#
# Format:
# Top-level keys are table names.
# Each item under the table name is read as an entry (entity) to be added to that table.
# Duplicates (entries where the primary key already exists in the table) are skipped, so this YAML file can be used
# to reload the same entries repeatedly.
# Only Manual, Lookup, and Part tables can be populated this way.
# All required fields, such as primary keys, for a table must be provided. Optional fields are optional.
# If a table has a `fetch_add` method defined (e.g., BrainRegion), then the primary key is not required, and
# `fetch_add` will be called on the key-value pairs provided.
# Editing this YAML by hand should be done very carefully because the foreign keys have to be set up before they
# are referenced. Often, it is easier and less error-prone to add these entries programmatically in DataJoint.
